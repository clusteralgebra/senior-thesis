author = {Thomas M Liggett},
abstract = {We prove that the convolution of two ultra-logconcave sequences is ultra-log-concave. This was conjectured recently by Pemantle and implies that a natural negative dependence property is preserved under the operation of “joining” families of exchangeable Bernoulli random variables.}
