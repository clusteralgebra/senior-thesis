abstract = {Recently, it was proved by Anari–Oveis Gharan–Vinzant, Anari–Liu–Oveis Gharan–Vinzant and Brändén–Huh that, for any matroid M, its basis generating polynomial and its independent set generating polynomial are log-concave on the positive orthant. Using these, they obtain some combinatorial inequalities on matroids including a solution of strong Mason's conjecture. In this paper, we study the strictness of the log-concavity of these polynomials and determine when equality holds in these combinatorial inequalities. We also consider a generalization of our result to morphisms of matroids.}

              on 10 lectures given at the CBMS workshop on spectral graph

              well-written exposition can be likened to a conversation with a
              good teacher-one who not only gives you the facts, but tells you
              what is really going on, why it is worth doing, and how it is
              related to familiar ideas in other areas. The monograph is
              accessible to the nonexpert who is interested in reading about
              this evolving area of mathematics.",
