abstract = {Recently, it was proved by Anari–Oveis Gharan–Vinzant, Anari–Liu–Oveis Gharan–Vinzant and Brändén–Huh that, for any matroid M, its basis generating polynomial and its independent set generating polynomial are log-concave on the positive orthant. Using these, they obtain some combinatorial inequalities on matroids including a solution of strong Mason's conjecture. In this paper, we study the strictness of the log-concavity of these polynomials and determine when equality holds in these combinatorial inequalities. We also consider a generalization of our result to morphisms of matroids.}

              well-written exposition can be likened to a conversation with a
              good teacher-one who not only gives you the facts, but tells you
              what is really going on, why it is worth doing, and how it is
              related to familiar ideas in other areas. The monograph is
              accessible to the nonexpert who is interested in reading about
              this evolving area of mathematics.",

               textbook of modern graph theory, now in its fifth edition,
               combines the authority of a classic with the engaging freshness
               of style that is the hallmark of active mathematics. It covers
               the core material of the subject with concise yet reliably
               complete proofs, while offering glimpses of more advanced
               methods in each field by one or two deeper results, again with
               proofs given in full detail. The book can be used as a reliable
               text for an introductory course, as a graduate text, and for
               self-study. New in this 5th edition: Sections on tangles and
               tree-width, on tree packing and covering, and on topological
               spaces as inverse limits of finite graphs. Several new proofs of
               classical theorems. Many new exercises. From the reviews: ``This
               outstanding book cannot be substituted with any other book on
               the present textbook market. It has every chance of becoming the
               standard textbook for graph theory.'' Acta Scientiarum
               Mathematicarum ``Deep, clear, wonderful. This is a serious book
               about the heart of graph theory. It has depth and integrity.''
               Persi Diaconis \& Ron Graham, SIAM Review ``The book has
               received a very enthusiastic reception, which it amply deserves.
               A masterly elucidation of modern graph theory.'' Bulletin of the
               Institute of Combinatorics and its Applications ``Succeeds
               dramatically… a hell of a good book.'' MAA Reviews ``A highlight
               of the book is what is by far the best account in print of the
