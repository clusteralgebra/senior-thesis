Using these, they obtain some combinatorial inequalities on matroids including a solution of strong Mason's conjecture. In this paper, we study the strictness of the log-concavity of these polynomials and determine when equality holds in these combinatorial inequalities. We also consider a generalization of our result to morphisms of matroids.}

               combines the authority of a classic with the engaging freshness
               of style that is the hallmark of active mathematics. It covers
               the core material of the subject with concise yet reliably
               complete proofs, while offering glimpses of more advanced
               methods in each field by one or two deeper results, again with
               proofs given in full detail. The book can be used as a reliable
               text for an introductory course, as a graduate text, and for
               self-study. New in this 5th edition: Sections on tangles and
               tree-width, on tree packing and covering, and on topological
               spaces as inverse limits of finite graphs. Several new proofs of
               classical theorems. Many new exercises. From the reviews: ``This
               outstanding book cannot be substituted with any other book on

abstract="We study multivariate entire functions and polynomials with non-negative coefficients. A class of Strongly Log-Concave entire functions, generalizing Minkowski volume polynomials, is introduced: an entire function f in m variables is called Strongly Log-Concave if the function {\$}({\backslash}partial x{\_}{\{}1{\}})^{\{}c{\_}{\{}1{\}}{\}}...({\backslash}partial x{\_}{\{}m{\}})^{\{}c{\_}{\{}m{\}}{\}}f{\$}is either zero or {\$}{\backslash}log(({\backslash}partial x{\_}{\{}1{\}})^{\{}c{\_}{\{}1{\}}{\}}...({\backslash}partial x{\_}{\{}m{\}})^{\{}c{\_}{\{}m{\}}{\}}f){\$}is concave on {\$}R{\_}{\{}+{\}}^{\{}m{\}}{\$}. We start with yet another point of view (of propagation) on the standard univariate (or homogeneous bivariate) Newton Inequalities. We prove analogues of the Newton Inequalities in the multivariate Strongly Log-Concave case. One of the corollaries of our new Newton-like inequalities is the fact that the support supp(f) of a Strongly Log-Concave entire function f is pseudo-convex (D-convex in our notation). The proofs are based on a natural convex relaxation of the derivatives Derf(r1,...,rm) of f at zero and on the lower bounds on Derf(r1,...,rm), which generalize the van der Waerden-Egorychev-Falikman inequality for the permanent of doubly-stochastic matrices. A few open questions are posed in the final section.",

               geometry in Euclidean space. After covering the basic concepts
               and results, it develops Brunn--Minkowski theory, with an
               exposition of mixed volumes, the Brunn--Minkowski inequality,
               and some of its consequences, including the isoperimetric
               inequality. Further central topics are then treated, such as
               surface area measures, projection functions, zonoids, and
               geometric valuations. Finally, an introduction to
               integral-geometric formulas in Euclidean space is provided. The
               numerous exercises and the supplementary material at the end of
               each section form an essential part of the book. Convexity is an
               elementary and natural concept. It plays a key role in many
               mathematical fields, including functional analysis,
               optimization, probability theory, and stochastic geometry.
               Paving the way to the more advanced and specialized literature,

Rivest has recently proposed the following intriguing conjecture: Let \$x^* \$ denote an arbitrary fixed element in an n-element partially ordered set P, and for each k in \$\{ 1,2, \cdots ,n \}\$ let \$N\_k \$ be the number of order-preserving maps from P onto \$\{ 1,2, \cdots ,n \}\$ that map \$x^* \$ into k. Then the sequence \$N\_1 , \cdots ,N\_n \$ is unimodal. This note proves the conjecture for the special case in which P can be covered by two linear orders. It also generalizes this result for P that have disjoint components, one of which can be covered by two linear orders. }

Chromatic polynomials are defined, their salient properties are derived, and some practical methods for computing them are given. A brief mention is made of the connection between the theory of chromatic polynomials and map coloring problems. The paper concludes with some unsolved problems relating to chromatic polynomials and to applications of the theory to practical problems in operations research.}

"The author has taken unusual care to motivate concepts and to simplify proofs. For example, the book presents - without having defined determinants - a clean proof that every linear operator on a finite-dimensional complex vector space (or an odd-dimensional real vector space) has an eigenvalue. A variety of interesting exercises in each chapter helps students understand and manipulate the objects of linear algebra."--Jacket.},
